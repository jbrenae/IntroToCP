# Bool only has TWO data types
#    - True and False

# Note: We capitalize the use of the False/True words
# These values are NOT strings or integers.
# They are SPECIAL Values JUST for Boolean variables.

#----- Example -----#

failed = True

if failed: 
    # only executed if failed has been set to true
