# FOUR Steps to creating a python list

# 1. Convert - each of the names into strings by putting quotes around the data.

#       "CGS 2060" "Introduction to Computers and Computer Programming" 3 
#           (Three is not a string it is a number so doesnt need quotes)

# 2. Seperate - Each list items with a comma

#       "CGS 2060", "Introduction to Computers and Computer Programming", 3 

# 3. Surround - Surround with opening and lcosing SQUARE brackets

#       ["CGS 2060", "Introduction to Computers and Computer Programming", 3]

# 4. Assign - Assign the list to a variable using the asisgnment operator (=) 

#       prerequisites = ["CGS 2060", "Intro to computer programmoinmg", 3]


# Full Example:
#  

prerequisites = ["CGS 2060", "Intro to computer programmoinmg", 3]

# Computer stores list in an ARRAY starting at index "0"
